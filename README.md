# **Personality Pokedex**

##A *new* take on the classic MBTI
##-Helps you find out which Myers-Briggs type you are while also likening you to a Pokemon of the same type!

*Personality Pokedex* will:
- Help you determine your own Myers-Briggs type
- Provide you with a Pokemon that shares the same Myers-Briggs type
- Give a brief description of your Myers-Briggs type 
- Allow you to read about other Myers-Briggs types and their corresponding Pokemon

*Personality Pokedex* is ideal for:
- People who want to discover their MBTI from a fun test
- People who are curious about what Pokemon corresponds to their Myers-Briggs type
- Anyone who wants to find out more about other Myers-Briggs types and their respective Pokemon

*Personality Pokedex* was designed after learning about the Myers-Briggs test in an Organizational Behavior class at
school and taking the 16personalities test with my fellow classmates. The idea of making a MBTI that provided a
matching "character" at the end seemed like a fun project while also being useful as it could still provide the same
results as a typical MBTI. Thus, I was inspired to create this project for the sake of my own a-MEW-sement.
Pokemon has always been one of my favorite games and the types within the game made it a fitting comparison for this
project. Unfortunately as there are only 3 starter Pokemon per generation I had to include a 4th to ensure I got all
16 possible Myers-Briggs types (I choose electric because Pikachu was a must have for a possible type :D)
